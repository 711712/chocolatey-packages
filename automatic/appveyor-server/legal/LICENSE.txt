special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages (including loss of profits); and

The limitations of this Section 14 shall apply to all causes of action, whether based on breach of warranty, breach of condition, breach of contract, fundamental breach or any other form of breach, negligence, other tort claims, strict liability or any other legal or equitable theory.
SECURITY
User Code.
As part of the Services, AppVeyor builds and tests User Code.
User Code resides in repository, which may be:
self-hosted Git, Mercurial, TFVC or Subversion repository;
hosted on GitHub, BitBucket, Visual Studio Team Services, Kiln or GitLab; or
hosted on other services.
In the provision of building and testing Services, AppVeyor downloads (clones) User Code to the Build Environment, which for greater certainty does not leave the boundaries of the Build Environment and is only retained in the Build Environment for the duration of the build using such User Code.
When a build is completed, the virtual machine handling such User Code is either deleted or restored to initial state and the User Code is removed from such virtual machine.
AppVeyor will not access User Code, build virtual machines, build and environment configurations, logs or artifacts without the User’s permission. By requesting any Services, you are deemed to be granting such permission to AppVeyor for the provision of such Services.
AppVeyor uses SSH keys or OAuth tokens whenever possible to clone code repository.
GitHub Scopes.
When authorized to access the User’s GitHub account, as applicable, AppVeyor will request the following OAuth scopes:
Public repositories:
read:org as required to get the list of organization public repositories customer has access to;
admin:repo_hook as required to create repository webhook when adding a project in AppVeyor;
repo:status as required to create commit status when a build is finished;
Private and public repositories:
repo as required to list user and organization private repositories, manage repository webhooks and SSH deployment keys, and create commit status when a build is finished.
Payment and other sensitive information.
When an application in AppVeyor accepts credit cards for any of the Services, User credit card information is not stored on the AppVeyor servers or database. Credit card details entered on the Site go directly to Stripe API via HTTPS and never reaches the AppVeyor servers. When such credit card information is validated by Stripe API, AppVeyor receives a special token which is used for making a payment. AppVeyor recommends that you refer to Stripe API's privacy policies for more information.
When an application in AppVeyor accepts any other sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, project and environment configurations, such sensitive information is stored in the AppVeyor database in encrypted form.
Third-Parties. AppVeyor may engage Third-Parties in the provision of the Services, from time to time. By accessing the Site or using any of the Services, you are authorizing AppVeyor to share information, including your Personal Information, with Third-Parties solely for the purpose of performing the applicable Services, as determined by AppVeyor in its sole discretion. For more information, AppVeyor recommends that you refer to the applicable Third-Party’s terms of service and privacy policies.
